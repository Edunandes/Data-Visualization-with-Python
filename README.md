Welcome to the Data Visualization Project! This repository contains a comprehensive suite of data visualization examples using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The primary objective of this project is to provide a wide range of visual representations for different types of data, aiding in the clear and effective communication of insights.

Features:

This project includes examples of the following chart types:

Bar Chart: Used to compare different categories or groups.

Pie Chart: Ideal for showing proportions and percentages.

Stacked Area Chart: Great for visualizing the cumulative effect of multiple data series.
Line Chart: Perfect for illustrating trends over time.
Histogram: Useful for depicting the distribution of numerical data.
Scatter Plot: Helps in identifying relationships between two numerical variables.
Regression Plot: Used to show the best fit line through the data points in a scatter plot, indicating trends and correlations.
Bar and Line Chart: Combines bar and line charts to show two types of data on the same axis.
